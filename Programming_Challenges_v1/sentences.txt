Being is the embodied experience. Unironically came to into the same conclusion as hedweb authors and now don't really think there's more to this shit, than imperative of perpetually seeking pleasurable bodily sensations. Phrased like garbage, but works. Either way, this thought was lurking for quite a while at the back of my mind. Seeing it finally resolved soothes me.
